# Program for Folder Synchronization

## Description
Program that executes a one-way synchronization from source(original) folder to a replica folder. Once running, enter the following: <sourceDir> <replicaDir> <intervalInSeconds> <logFilePath>
Since the program synchronizes two folders, both <sourceDir> and <replicaDir> need to exist. The synchronization detects file/folder additions, removals and updates. Type QUIT to exit program.
